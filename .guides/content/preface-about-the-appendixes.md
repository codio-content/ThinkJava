The chapters of this book are meant to be read in order, because each one builds on the previous one.
We also include several appendixes with material that can be read at any time:



**Appendix A: Tools**



This appendix explains how to download and install Java so you can compile programs on your computer.

It also provides a brief introduction to DrJava -- an “integrated development environment” (IDE) that is designed primarily for students -- and other development tools, including Checkstyle for code quality and JUnit for testing.



**Appendix B: Javadoc**



It's important to document your classes and methods so that other programmers (including yourself in the future) will know how to use them.

This appendix explains how to read documentation, how to write documentation, and how to use the Javadoc tool.



**Appendix C: Graphics**



Java provides libraries for working with graphics and animation, and these topics can be engaging for students.

The libraries require object-oriented features that students will not completely understand until after Chapter 0, but they can be used much earlier.



**Appendix D: Debugging**



We provide debugging suggestions throughout the book, but we also have an appendix with many more suggestions on how to debug your programs.

We recommend that readers review this appendix frequently as they work through the book.



**Appendix E: Extras**



With each new edition, we add new material, remove old material, and revise everything else.

Some of the old material may still be useful, so rather than delete it, we moved it to this appendix.
