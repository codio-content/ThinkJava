**Exercise 11.3:**

In the board game Scrabble, each tile contains a letter, which is used to spell words in rows and columns, and a score, which is used to determine the value of words.



1.  Write a definition for a class named `Tile` that represents Scrabble tiles.
The instance variables should include a character named `letter` and an integer named `value`.

1.  Write a constructor that takes parameters named `letter` and `value` and initializes the instance variables.

1.  Write a method named `printTile` that takes a `Tile` object as a parameter and displays the instance variables in a reader-friendly format.

1.  Write a method named `testTile` that creates a `Tile` object with the letter `Z` and the value `10`, and then uses `printTile` to display the state of the object.

1.  Implement the `toString` and `equals` methods for a `Tile`.

1.  Create getters and setters for each of the attributes.


The point of this exercise is to practice the mechanical part of creating a new class definition.
