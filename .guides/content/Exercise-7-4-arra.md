The Sieve of Eratosthenes is “a simple, ancient algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to any given limit,” which you can read about at [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes).

Write a method called `sieve` that takes an integer parameter, `n`, and returns a `boolean` array that indicates, for each number from `0` to `n - 1`, whether the number is prime.
