**Exercise 11.4:**

Write a class definition for `Date`, an object type that contains three integers: `year`, `month`, and `day`.
This class should provide two constructors.
The first should take no parameters and initialize a default date.
The second should take parameters named `year`, `month` and `day`, and use them to initialize the instance variables.

Write a `main` method that creates a new `Date` object named `birthday`.
The new object should contain your birth date.
You can use either constructor.
