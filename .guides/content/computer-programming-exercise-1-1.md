**Exercise 1.1:**
Computer scientists have the annoying habit of using common English words to mean something other than their common English meaning.
For example, in English, statements and comments are the same thing, but in programs they are different.


1.  In computer jargon, what's the difference between a statement and a comment?
1.  What does it mean to say that a program is portable?
1.  In common English, what does the word compile mean?
1.  What is an executable? Why is that word used as a noun?

The glossary at the end of each chapter is intended to highlight words and phrases that have special meanings in computer science. When you see familiar words, don't assume that you know what they mean!
