As you learned in the previous chapter, an object is a collection of data that provides a set of methods. For example, a `String` is a collection of characters that provides methods like `charAt` and `substring`.

In this chapter, we'll explore two new types of objects: `Point` and `Rectangle`. We'll see how to write methods that take objects as parameters and produce objects as return values.

We will also take a first look at the source code for the Java library.
