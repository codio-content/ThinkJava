**Exercise 4.1:**

The purpose of this exercise is to take code from a previous exercise and redesign it as a method that takes parameters.
You should start with a working solution to Exercise 2.2.



1.  Write a method called `printAmerican` that takes the day, date, month and year as parameters and that displays them in American format.

1.  Test your method by invoking it from `main` and passing appropriate arguments.
The output should look something like this (except that the date might be different):

```code
Saturday, July 22, 2015
```

1.  Once you have debugged `printAmerican`, write another method called `printEuropean` that displays the date in European format.
