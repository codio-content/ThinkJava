Write a program that converts a total number of seconds to hours, minutes, and seconds. It should (1) prompt the user for input, (2) read an integer from the keyboard, (3) calculate the result, and (4) use `printf` to display the output.

For example, `"5000 seconds = 1 hours, 23 minutes, and 20 seconds"`.

*Hint:* Use the remainder operator.
