**Exercise 2.1:**
Before you do anything else, find out how to compile and run a Java program.
Some environments provide sample programs similar to the example in Section 0.3.


1.  Type in the hello world program, then compile and run it.
1.  Add a print statement that displays a second message after the “Hello, World!”.
Say something witty like, “How are you?”
Compile and run the program again.
1.  Add a comment to the program (anywhere), recompile, and run it again.
The new comment should not affect the result.

This exercise may seem trivial, but it is the starting place for many of the programs we will work with.
To debug with confidence, you will need to have confidence in your programming environment.
In some environments, it is easy to lose track of which program is executing.
You might find yourself trying to debug one program while you are accidentally running another.
Adding (and changing) print statements is a simple way to be sure that the program you are looking at is the program you are running.
