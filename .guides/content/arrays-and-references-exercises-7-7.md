**Exercise 8.1:**

Write a method called `letterHist` that takes a string as a parameter and returns a histogram of the letters in the string.
The zeroth element of the histogram should contain the number of a's in the string (upper- and lowercase); the 25th element should contain the number of z's.
Your solution should only traverse the string once.
