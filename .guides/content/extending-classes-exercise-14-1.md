Design a better strategy for the `Player.play` method. For example, if there are multiple cards you can play, and one of them is an eight, you might want to play the eight.

Think of other ways you can minimize penalty points, such as playing the highest-ranking cards first. Write a new class that extends `Player` and overrides `play` to implement your strategy.
