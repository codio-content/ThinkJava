      \begin{exercise}  %%V6 Ex1.1
      Computer scientists have the annoying habit of using common English words to mean something other than their common English meaning.
      For example, in English, statements and comments are the same thing, but in programs they are different.
      \begin{enumerate}
      \item In computer jargon, what's the difference between a statement and a comment?
      \item What does it mean to say that a program is portable?
      \item In common English, what does the word compile mean?
      \item What is an executable? Why is that word used as a noun?
      \end{enumerate}
      The glossary at the end of each chapter is intended to highlight words and phrases that have special meanings in computer science.
      When you see familiar words, don't assume that you know what they mean!

      \begin{exercise}  %%V6 Ex1.2
      Before you do anything else, find out how to compile and run a Java program.
      Some environments provide sample programs similar to the example in Section~\ref{hello}.
      \begin{enumerate}
      \item Type in the hello world program, then compile and run it.
      \item Add a print statement that displays a second message after the ``Hello, World!''.
      Say something witty like, ``How are you?''
      Compile and run the program again.
      \item Add a comment to the program (anywhere), recompile, and run it again.
      The new comment should not affect the result.
      \end{enumerate}
      This exercise may seem trivial, but it is the starting place for many of the programs we will work with.
      To debug with confidence, you will need to have confidence in your programming environment.
      In some environments, it is easy to lose track of which program is executing.
      You might find yourself trying to debug one program while you are accidentally running another.
      Adding (and changing) print statements is a simple way to be sure that the program you are looking at is the program you are running.

      \begin{exercise}  %%V6 Ex1.3
      It is a good idea to commit as many errors as you can think of, so that you see what error messages the compiler produces.
      Sometimes the compiler tells you exactly what is wrong, and all you have to do is fix it.
      But sometimes the error messages are misleading.
      Over time you will develop a sense for when you can trust the compiler and when you have to figure things out yourself.
      Starting with the hello world program, try out each of the following errors.
      After you make each change, compile the program, read the error message (if there is one), and then fix the error.
      \begin{enumerate}
      \item Remove one of the open curly braces.
      \item Remove one of the close curly braces.
      \item Instead of \java{main}, write \java{mian}.
      \item Remove the word \java{static}.
      \item Remove the word \java{public}.
      \item Remove the word \java{System}.
      \item Replace \java{println} with \java{Println}.
      \item Replace \java{println} with \java{print}.
      \item Delete one of the parentheses.
      \item Add an extra parenthesis.

      \begin{exercise}  %%V6 Ex3.1

      When you use \java{printf}, the Java compiler does not check your format string.
      See what happens if you try to display a value with type \java{int} using \java{\%f}.
      And what happens if you display a \java{double} using \java{\%d}?
      What if you use two format specifiers, but then only provide one value?

      \begin{exercise}  %%V6 Ex3.2

      Write a program that converts a temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit.
      It should (1) prompt the user for input, (2) read a \java{double} value from the keyboard, (3) calculate the result, and (4) format the output to one decimal place.
      For example, it should display {\tt "24.0 C = 75.2 F"}.

      Here is the formula.
      Be careful not to use integer division!
      %
      \[ F = C \times \frac{9}{5} + 32 \]

      \begin{exercise}  %%V6 Ex3.3

      Write a program that converts a total number of seconds to hours, minutes, and seconds.
      It should (1) prompt the user for input, (2) read an integer from the keyboard, (3) calculate the result, and (4) use \java{printf} to display the output.
      For example, {\tt "5000 seconds = 1 hours, 23 minutes, and 20 seconds"}.

      {\it Hint:} Use the remainder operator.

      \label{guess}

      The goal of this exercise is to program a ``Guess My Number'' game.
      When it's finished, it will work like this:

      \begin{stdout}
      I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100
      (including both). Can you guess what it is?
      Type a number: 45
      Your guess is: 45
      The number I was thinking of is: 14
      You were off by: 31
      \end{stdout}

      To choose a random number, you can use the \java{Random} class in \java{java.util}.
      Here's how it works:

      \index{GuessStarter.java}

      \begin{trinket}{GuessStarter.java}
      import java.util.Random;

      public class GuessStarter {

          public static void main(String[] args) {
              // pick a random number
              Random random = new Random();
              int number = random.nextInt(100) + 1;
              System.out.println(number);
          }
      }
      \end{trinket}

      \index{new}
      \index{operator!new}

      Like the \java{Scanner} class we saw in this chapter, \java{Random} has to be imported before we can use it.
      And as we saw with \java{Scanner}, we have to use the \java{new} operator to create a \java{Random} (number generator).

      Then we can use the method \java{nextInt} to generate a random number.
      In this example, the result of \java{nextInt(100)} will be between 0 and 99, including both.
      Adding 1 yields a number between 1 and 100, including both.

      \begin{enumerate}

      \item The definition of \java{GuessStarter} is in a file called {\tt GuessStarter.java}, in the directory called {\tt ch03}, in the repository for this book.
      %Instructions for downloading this code are on page~\pageref{code}.

      \item Compile and run this program.

      \item Modify the program to prompt the user, then use a \java{Scanner} to read a line of user input.
      Compile and test the program.

      \item Read the user input as an integer and display the result.
      Again, compile and test.

      \item Compute and display the difference between the user's guess and the number that was generated.

      \end{enumerate}

      \end{exercise}
