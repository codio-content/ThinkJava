A word is said to be a “doubloon” if every letter that appears in the word appears exactly twice.
Here are some example doubloons found in the dictionary:

> Abba, Anna, appall, appearer, appeases, arraigning, beriberi, bilabial, boob, Caucasus, coco, Dada, deed, Emmett, Hannah, horseshoer, intestines, Isis, mama, Mimi, murmur, noon, Otto, papa, peep, reappear, redder, sees, Shanghaiings, Toto

Write a method called `isDoubloon` that takes a string and checks whether it is a doubloon. To ignore case, invoke the `toLowerCase` method before checking.
