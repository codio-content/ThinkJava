##  Methods and testing


So far we've written programs that have only one method (`main`).
In this chapter, we'll show you how to organize programs into multiple methods.
We'll also learn how to trace the order in which a program runs.
Finally, we'll discuss strategies for incrementally developing and testing your code.
