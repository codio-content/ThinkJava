The code for this chapter is in the `ch10` directory of `ThinkJavaCode2`.
See page in section Using the code examples for instructions on how to download the repository.
Before you start the exercises, we recommend that you compile and run the examples.

At this point you know enough to read Appendix 17, which is about simple 2D graphics and animations.
During the next few chapters, you should take a detour to read this appendix and work through the exercises.
