##  Objects of arrays



In the previous chapter, we defined a class to represent cards and used an array of `Card` objects to represent a deck.
In this chapter, we take another step toward object-oriented programming by defining a class to represent a deck of cards.
We then present algorithms for shuffling and sorting decks.
Finally, we introduce `ArrayList` from the Java library and use it to keep track of different piles of cards from the deck.
