Java programs have three different types of comments:



1.  **End-of-line comments** (`//`), which generally contain short phrases that explain specific lines of code.
1.  **Multi-line comments** (`/*`), which are typically only used for copyright statements at the top of the file.
1.  **Documentation comments** (`/**`), which describe in sufficient detail what each class and method does.


End-of-line and multi-line comments are written primarily for yourself. They help you remember specific details about your source code. Documentation comments, on the other hand, are written for others. They explain how to use your classes and methods in other programs.


A nice feature of the Java language is the ability to embed documentation in the source code itself. That way, you can write it as you go, and as things change, it is easier to keep the documentation consistent with the code.

You can extract documentation from your source code, and generate well-formatted HTML pages, using a tool called **Javadoc**. This tool is included with the Java compiler, and it is widely used. In fact, the official documentation for the Java library ([https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/)) is generated by Javadoc.
