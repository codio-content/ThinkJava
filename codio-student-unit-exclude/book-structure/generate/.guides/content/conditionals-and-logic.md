##  Conditionals and logic



The programs we've seen in previous chapters do pretty much the same thing every time, regardless of the input.
For more complex computations, programs usually react to inputs, check for certain conditions, and generate applicable results.
This chapter introduces Java language features for expressing logic and making decisions.
We'll also take a look at the `Math` class, which provides methods for common mathematical operations.
