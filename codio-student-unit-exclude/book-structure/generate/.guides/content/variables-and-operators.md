This chapter describes how to write statements using *variables*, which store values like numbers and words, and *operators*, which are symbols that perform a computation.
We also explain three kinds of programming errors and offer additional debugging advice.

To run the examples in this chapter, you will need to create a new Java class with a `main` method (see Section 1.3).
We often omit the class and method definitions to keep the examples concise.
