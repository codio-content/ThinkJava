**Exercise 5.5:**

Now that we have conditional statements, we can get back to the “Guess My Number” game from Exercise guess.

You should already have a program that chooses a random number, prompts the user to guess it, and displays the difference between the guess and the chosen number.

Adding a small amount of code at a time, and testing as you go, modify the program so it tells the user whether the guess is too high or too low, and then prompts the user for another guess.

The program should continue until the user gets it right or guesses incorrectly three times.
If the user guesses the correct number, display a message and terminate the program.
