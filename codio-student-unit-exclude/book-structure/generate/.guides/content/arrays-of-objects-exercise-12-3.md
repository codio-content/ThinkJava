**Exercise 13.1:**

In Poker a “flush” is a hand that contains five or more cards of the same suit.
A hand can contain any number of cards.




1.  Write a method called `suitHist` that takes an array of cards as a parameter and that returns a histogram of the suits in the hand.
Your solution should only traverse the array once.

1.  Write a method called `hasFlush` that takes an array of cards as a parameter and returns `true` if the hand contains a flush (and `false` otherwise).
